            price and volume dynamics, and firms may have differing financial
            motivations. To protect competitive interests, BitcoinL2 Labs does
            not disclose the firms’ identities or program details. By engaging
            with the sBTC ecosystem, you accept that these incentives may
            influence trading activity and should conduct due diligence before
            participating.
